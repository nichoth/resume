Hi npm humans. So npm is an incredible tool that has changed the way everyone works. But the reason I'm contacting you is because the people who work there have cool politics. I'm just going on what I know of your employees' and company's online presences, but you seem to consistently support smart, progressive values, which is kind of rare in the tech world. So I would get to work with and learn from great developers with diverse backgrounds, and not feel guilty about the product I'm making.

This is my situation. I have spent the last 4 years or so making applications with JavaScript. My main focus is client side applications -- finding the best user experience and development practices for apps in the browser. That's what my current job is. We make a program for working with videos online, and it's great. I get to do what I would be doing anyway, researching development in JS. I do various other things too, different languages and tools, but the main thing is JavaScript. So I love my job, but I would also like to work with more people, and I would like to be in the bay area because people protest things there. I could go on about that, but that's the short version.
