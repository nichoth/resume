# Nick Thomas
Web Developer

<p class="intro">
    I build things for the web &mdash; usually with TypeScript, often
    from scratch. I care about clean code, good docs, and working with
    others who care.  Recently focused on end-to-end encryption,
    accessible content, and modern edge deployments.
