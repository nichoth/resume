Hello. I have focused heavily on javascript for the last several years. My most recent job was working on a long term project, a react-based CMS for video content. I'm passionate about front-end javascript and node.js. I have ~6 years experience with web development, and a portfolio here -- https://github.com/nichoth/ and at https://nichoth.com/. Please contact me if you would like to hire me.
