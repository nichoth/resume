I started programming seriously when node js was in its early days, and I have focused heavily on javascript since then. My most recent job was working on a long term project, a react-based CMS for video content. I'm passionate about front-end javascript and node.js. I have ~6 years experience with web development, and a portfolio here -- https://nichoth.com/.
